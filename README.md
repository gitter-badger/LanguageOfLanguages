Language of Languages (LoLs)
====

Language of Languages (LoLs) is a Language Workbench for integrating languages with different notations. Languages can be quickly implemented in LoLs using OMeta/JS to create an interpreter or translator to another language. This open source development leverages OMeta/JS to bootstrap the initial release of the LoLs Workbench. Currently, a seed release is available. Most of the workbench features are yet to be implemented. We have a minimal working language workbench. This version supports textual languages and enough functionality to develop future releases.

We are creating a Software as a Service Language Workbench which operates only on the client side. Nothing to download or install. All user information remains on the clients computer.
